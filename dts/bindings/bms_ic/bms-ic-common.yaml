description: Common properties for battery management ICs

properties:
  shunt-resistor-uohm:
    type: int
    description: |
      Shunt resistor value in micro-Ohm.

  board-max-current:
    type: int
    description: |
      Maximum current allowed by the board design in Amperes.

  io-channels:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      List of extra NTCs that are connected to ADC channels of the MCU.
      Each entry is a phandle to an ADC controller plus the channel number.

  ntc-enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO to power the NTCs.

  num-fet-ntcs:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of NTCs connected to the FETs for over-temperature protection.
      The rest of the NTCs (if any) are assumed to be connected to the cells.
